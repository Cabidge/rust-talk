# About

Hello fello devo! Welcome to the *web version* of the Rust TEDxSoftDev talk!

This site gives a brief overview of a number of different features that Rust
has to offer to help you decide whether you'd want to consider Rust for a next
project or not.

## Code blocks

You'll see many code blocks littered throughout the various pages like this:
```rust
# fn main() {
println!("Wow!");
# }
```
These are interactable! Try clicking the triangular run button and you'll be
to see the output of the program.
